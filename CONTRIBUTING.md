# Contributing Guide

ðŸ‘‹Thank you for taking the time to read this and I look forward to reviewing your contribution.

## Contribution instructions:

- Create a fork of the project on Github.
- Clone the fork on your local machine. Your remote repo on Github is called `origin`.
- Add the original repository as a remote called `upstream`.
- If you created your fork a while ago be sure to pull upstream changes into your local repository.
- Create a new branch to work on! Branch from `trunk`.
- Please make an issue to reference and implement/fix your feature.
- Please add unit tests, **jest** is the testing tool.
- Make a pull request (PR) to merge into `trunk` and make sure it passes the continuous integration pipeline.
- You're PR will be reviewed as soon as possible.
