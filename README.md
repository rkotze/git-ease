The idea is very much WIP.

> Making it easy to make manage Git

### Problem

I find the current UI features in VS Code too limiting to represent Git features in a convenient way. There is also so many connected documents to Git repos (issues, PRs, etc) which i think can be more visible.

### Vision

Introduce a clean and interactive UI for viewing the Git log in VS Code SCM panel.

**Status** Currently building Alpha release
